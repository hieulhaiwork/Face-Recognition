# Face Recognition Project

In many situations, we want to deploy a facial recognition device to protect something from strangers, but the device is limited in hardware, which can make the facial recognition process slow and unreliable if using inappropriate models. 

This is my personal project where I will deploy a pre-trained YuNet model for face detection combined with an ANN method to retrieve faces in the database to ensure accuracy and execution time. Also, set up a mechanism to add new faces without retraining the models. 

### YuNet

YuNet is a light-weight, fast and accurate face detection model, which achieves 0.834(easy), 0.824(medium), 0.708(hard) on the WIDER Face validation set.

### ANN
